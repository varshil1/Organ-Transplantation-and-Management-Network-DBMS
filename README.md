## Problem Statement
Organ Transplantation is one of the major life-saving techniques utilized by
medical professionals nowadays. It is the process in which an organ is removed
from one body through surgery and placed in the body of a recipient who is in
need of that, to replace a damaged or a missing organ. There are two types of
persons involved in it: Donors and Recipients. They may be at the same location
or organs may be transported from one location to another subject to distance,
time and other risks.
For all this, a proper management system is essential. Organ Donation And
Transplantation Management Network System plays a vital role in today’s
medical institutions which are responsible for the evaluation, testing, and
procurement of organs for organ transplantation. The main goal of these
organizations aims to identify the best candidates for the available organs and
to coordinate it with the medical institutions and hospitals to decide on each
organ recipient. They also conduct awareness programs for the importance of
donating organs and also keeps the track record of all the transplantations
carried to date.

This management and network system is a database management system that
uses database technology to keep, construct, develop, maintain and manipulate
various kinds of data about a person’s donation or procurement of a particular
organ. It maintains a comprehensive medical history and other critical
information like blood group, age, gender, location, etc, which can affect the
donation process of every person(i.e. Both donor and recipient in the database
design. In short, it contains all the data and statistical information regarding the
network of organ donation and procurement of different patients and donors.

## Motivation 
The motivation behind this project is a severe issue to be handled by the
country. The situation of organ wastage is a major issue in our country and
mostly in the case of heart. For this, it becomes utmost essential to have a
centrally administered proper database of all patients, donors, and doctors in a
well-formed way that can be processed easily. So, we aim to create a solution
that effectively deals with the problems of finding donors and also providing
statistical data of the transplants that can help the government to form better
rules and regulations.
